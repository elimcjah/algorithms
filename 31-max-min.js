// Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, 
// as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters. The range will be an 
// array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order. e.g. for 1 and 3 - find the 
// smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3.

// smallestCommons([1, 5]) should return a number.
// smallestCommons([1, 5]) should return 60.
// smallestCommons([5, 1]) should return 60.
// smallestCommons([1, 13]) should return 360360.
// smallestCommons([23, 18]) should return 6056820.

// PROBLEM:

function smallestCommons(arr) {
 return num;
}

smallestCommons([23,18]);


// SOLUTION:


// Put solution here.
